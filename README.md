## Purpose

The MyRecallAppClient IOS app is used to **test** exporting and importing a JSON representation of the MyRecallApp topics (SwiftData, in CloudKit) outside the IOS app sandbox.

For this purpose, the [MyRecallAppService](https://github.com/SwiftProjectOrganization/MyRecallAppService) is used as counterpart using the Swift OpenApi generator project to define the protocol.
